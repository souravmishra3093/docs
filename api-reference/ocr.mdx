# How Does API Work?

The OCR API uses App ID and API Key to authenticate requests. Your credentials carry many privileges, so keep them secure.

- **Pass valid login credentials**:
  - Rev App ID
  - App Key
  - App Name (OCR)

- Upload the file (PDF or image)

- Select the language and process type

- Validate user credentials & load default account settings

- Returns
  - **layout_ocr**: DOCX file with preserved layout

  - **only_ocr**: Plain text file
