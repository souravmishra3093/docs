All API endpoints are authenticated using API Subscription Keys provided by Sarvam AI when you sign up. Include these keys in the header of each API request as follows:

```yaml
api-subscription-key: <your-api-key>
```

### Obtaining Your API Subscription Key

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on the Reverie Dashboard

2. **Generate Key**: When you sign up, an API key is generated for your account and shown in the dashboard.

3. **Organisation Key Management**: Create Organisational level keys is not currently supported and will be available soon.

### Using the API Subscription Key

To authenticate your requests, include the `API-Subscription-Key` in the headers of your HTTP requests. Hereâ€™s an example using Python and the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.rev.ai/<api-endpoint>'
headers = {
    'API-Subscription-Key': 'your-api-key'
}
data = {
    'text': 'Rev AI is a powerful platform for LLM tasks.'
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### Best Practices for API Key Management

1. **Keep Your Key Secret**: Never expose your API key in public repositories or client-side code.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding it in your application.

3. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your API usage on the Sarvam dashboard. You should be able to see the credits utilised & remaining
